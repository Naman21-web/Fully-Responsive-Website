            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and
                implementation were determined legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to
                the constitution in 1976 made education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state
                governments shared formal responsibility for funding and administration of education.In a country as
                large as India, now with 28 states and seven union territories, this means that the potential for
                variations between states in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is
                vast. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of
                state-level programs and policies.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small text-left-small">An important challenge for the Indian economy over the next few decades
                is to exploit the “demographic dividend” of having a large share of the population of working age. This
                dividend will only be earned with a well-educated workforce which in turn requires a strong school
                system.
                In recent decades, India has increased school enrolment but struggled to deliver actual learning. An
                annual survey conducted by the NGO Pratham spotlights large learning deficits in basic reading and
                arithmetic. Only half of Class V students can read texts meant for Class II. More than half the students
                in Class VIII struggle to do simple division. Behind these abysmal outcomes are major structural
                problems including ineffective and sometimes absent school teachers, particularly in rural
                India.Education technology (Edtech), mainly information and communication technology, can address these
                problems by delivering better lessons, training teachers and motivating students. In recent decades, the
                cost of computing has plummeted to the point where edtech is feasible even in relatively poor countries.
                Tablets cost as little as Rs. 2000 and India has the cheapest mobile data plans in the world.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The number of graduates coming out of technical colleges increased to
                over 700,000 in 2011 from 550,000 in FY 2010.[104][105] However, according to one study, 75% of
                technical graduates and more than 85% of general graduates lack the skills needed in India's most
                demanding and high-growth global industries such as Information Technology.[106] These high-tech global
                information technologies companies directly or indirectly employ about 2.3 million people, less than 1%
                of India's labour pool.[107] India offers one of the largest pool of technically skilled graduates in
                the world. Given the sheer numbers of students seeking education in engineering, science and
                mathematics, India faces daunting challenges in scaling up capacity while maintaining quality. This is
